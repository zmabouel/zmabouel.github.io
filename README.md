Undergraduate Research Assistant @ McAlister Heart Institute, Griffith Lab
* Perform advanced digital imaging of embryonic hearts while training a machine learning algorithm to identify the cardiac jelly
* Collaborate with the Griffith Lab to help model blood flow in embryonic heats to help solve future heat defects in the future

### Projects
Slot Machine
* Utilized Python to create a game where players can 'spin' virtual reels with various symbols, and wins are determined based on the alignment of these symbols after each spin. 
*	Leveraged functions, conditionals, and nested loops to complete this project. 
*	Implemented a straightforward betting system and payout calculations and allowed the user to continuously repeat so long as they continue to add money.

Password Generator

*	Developed a sophisticated password generator in Python, capable of producing secure, custom passwords based on user-defined criteria. 
*	Implemented a feature to categorize passwords as 'strong' or ‘weak’ based on inclusion of special characters and/or numbers and would save this password in its respective list. 
*	This project solved my problem of coming up with passwords and I use this program to date.
